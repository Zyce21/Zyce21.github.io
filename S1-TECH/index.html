            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a driven and entrepreneurial-minded individual with a passion for business, finance, and innovation. My journey into the world of entrepreneurship began during my high school years, where I developed a strong foundation in business management, leadership, and problem-solving. Over the years, I have leveraged this foundation to successfully launch and manage my own ventures, achieving significant milestones and learning valuable lessons along the way. I'm currently studying in FEU Institute of Technology and I major in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with Specialization in Web and Mobile Applications (BSITWMA). I can also do simple programming in C++ if needed.</p>
